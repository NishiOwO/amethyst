 # Things to do after self hosting:
 - Modules (probably will pull a Zig and make them structures that contain stuff)
 - Algebraic data types
 - Typeclasses
 - Standard library
 - Compile time reference counting
 - Mutability/immutability distinction
 - Less parenthetical syntax
 - """Dependent types""" for integer types
 - Multiple backends
